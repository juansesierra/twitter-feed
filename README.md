# Introduction
The point of this project is to showcase my abilities to develop a small app to search users in Twitter.

The app was developed using  electron and React.

The app has two principal functions: search users and filter user's tweets. In addition, we have to store the last 5 searchs and show them everytime that user tries to search.

All the search process ocurrs in the main process.

# Setup the project

For this project to run properly we need to follow these steps:
* Clone this repository

    `git clone https://github.com/juansesierra/twitter-feed.git`
* Install dependencies `npm i`
* Start the application `npm run electron-start`

# App
Once you start the app, this is the state that you will see.
If we want to search a user, you only have to write his name without "@" and click the button.

For example we are going to search Ibai Llanos' profile
